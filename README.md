# Advanced-Network-Security-Assessment-Tool-Python-
This project is a comprehensive Python-based network security assessment tool designed to help users and network administrators evaluate the security posture of their local networks. It automates the process of discovering active devices, scanning for open ports, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and generating detailed security reports.

The tool emphasizes ethical use only on networks you own or have permission to test.
